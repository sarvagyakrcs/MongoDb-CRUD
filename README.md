# Experiment 2: MongoDB Starter Template

## Step 1: Clone the Starter Package
The MongoDB setup is already included in the codebase. Simply clone the repository:
```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-project-folder>
```

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables
Add your MongoDB connection string inside a `.env` file in your project root:
```env
MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
```
Replace `<your-mongodb-connection-string>` with your actual MongoDB connection string from MongoDB Atlas.

## Step 3: Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install dependencies:
```sh
bun install
```

## Step 4: Start the Development Server
Run the project locally:
```sh
bun dev
```

Your MongoDB setup is complete! ðŸŽ‰ Just add your `.env` file and start building.
